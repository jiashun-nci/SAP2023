## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
cd secure
./mvnw
```
Open web broswer
```
http://localhost:8080
```
